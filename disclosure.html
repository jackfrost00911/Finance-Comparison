        <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 4, 2025</p>

        <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
        <p>CardMatch is an independent credit card comparison and review website that earns revenue through affiliate partnerships with credit card issuers and financial institutions.</p>

        <h2>Affiliate Relationships</h2>
        <p>We maintain affiliate relationships with various credit card issuers and financial service providers, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Major credit card banks (Chase, American Express, Citi, Discover, Capital One, etc.)</li>
            <li>Regional banks and credit unions</li>
            <li>Credit monitoring services</li>
            <li>Financial comparison platforms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Compensation Works</h2>
        <p>When you click on certain links on our Site and apply for a credit card or financial product, we may receive compensation from the issuer or affiliate network. Compensation may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed payments per approved application</li>
            <li>Percentage-based commissions</li>
            <li>Performance bonuses</li>
            <li>Cost-per-click payments (less common)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> You do not pay more by using our links. Pricing, terms, rates, and bonuses are identical whether you apply through our Site or directly through the issuer.</p>

        <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
        <p>Our reviews, comparisons, and recommendations are based on objective analysis and research. We evaluate cards based on factors including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Earning rates and rewards value</li>
            <li>Annual fees and other costs</li>
            <li>Sign-up bonuses and promotional offers</li>
            <li>Travel perks, insurance, and benefits</li>
            <li>User experience and customer service</li>
            <li>Overall value for different spending patterns</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Affiliate compensation does NOT influence our editorial rankings or recommendations.</strong> We recommend cards that provide genuine value to consumers, regardless of commission rates.</p>

        <h2>Not All Links Are Affiliate Links</h2>
        <p>Some links on our Site are non-affiliate links included for informational purposes or to improve user experience. We link to resources that we believe are helpful, whether or not we earn compensation.</p>

        <h2>Cards We Don't Get Paid For</h2>
        <p>We may review and recommend credit cards for which we do not have affiliate relationships. If a card offers exceptional value, we'll recommend it even if we don't earn a commission.</p>

        <h2>Transparency Commitment</h2>
        <p>In addition to this disclosure page, we include clear affiliate disclosures on pages featuring affiliate links, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Homepage disclaimers</li>
            <li>Category comparison page notices</li>
            <li>Individual card review disclosures</li>
            <li>In-content disclosures near affiliate links</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Issuer Terms Apply</h2>
        <p>Credit card approval is subject to issuer terms and credit review. Advertised rates, fees, bonuses, and terms are subject to change without notice. Always verify current details on the issuer's website before applying.</p>

        <h2>FTC Compliance</h2>
        <p>This disclosure complies with the Federal Trade Commission's requirements for affiliate relationships and endorsements (16 CFR Part 255).</p>
