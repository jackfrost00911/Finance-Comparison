    <h1>Blue Cash Preferred® Card Review: The VIP Pass for Grocery Store Royalty and Binge Watchers</h1>
    <p>
        If you spend half your paycheck on groceries and the other half on Netflix, the <span class="snark">Blue Cash Preferred® Card</span> might just be your new spirit animal. It’s the only card that makes you feel good about compulsive snacking while you stream the latest overrated show.
    </p>
    <h2>What Rocks?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>6% cash back on U.S. supermarkets</b> (up to $6,000/year)—that’s a whole lot of cartoon cereal, friend.</li>
        <li><b>6% cash back on U.S. streaming services</b>—might as well get paid for your couch potato status.</li>
        <li><b>3% cash back on transit</b> (taxis, rideshares, parking, trains)—commuting finally pays off. (Well, sort of.)</li>
        <li><b>3% back on U.S. gas stations</b>—fuel up and don’t feel bad doing it.</li>
        <li><b>1% back on everything else</b>—the afterthought, but hey, it’s something.</li>
        <li><b>Welcome bonus</b>: $250 after spending $3,000 in 6 months. Buy enough groceries and you’re there.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What Sucks?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>$0 intro annual fee for the first year, then $95—ouch at renewal time.</li>
        <li>6% back cap on groceries disappears after $6,000. (Hello, limits.)</li>
        <li>Some streaming platforms mysteriously “don’t count” (read the fine print or risk tears).</li>
        <li>Amex isn’t accepted everywhere—leave your supermarket palace and it gets dicey.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>So, Who Is This For?</h2>
    <p>
        This is the card for snackers, commuters, and hardcore binge-watchers—the “I’m not rich, but treat me like I am” crowd. If you don’t spend at supermarkets or have every streaming app, skip it.
    </p>
    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
        The <span class="snark">Blue Cash Preferred® Card</span> rewards the truly average American lifestyle: eating, streaming, and griping about gas prices. It’s a must-have for maximizing everyday purchases. Just watch those annual fees or they’ll eat into your snack budget.
