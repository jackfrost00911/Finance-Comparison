    <h1>Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card Review: When Your Side Hustle Deserves Main Character Energy</h1>
    <p>
        If your “business” is mostly a lot of receipts, late nights, and maybe a couple of midnight pizza orders, the <span class="snark">Ink Business Unlimited®</span> is the card you want. It’s the freelancer, consultant, and small biz go-to: simple, unlimited 1.5% cash back on everything, with as little fine print as possible. Finally, a business card that doesn’t ask if you have a fax machine.
    </p>
    <h2>The Perks—So You Can Focus on Not Working</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>1.5% cash back on every purchase</b>, no categories, no games—just pure simplicity for your business expenses and your “business” expenses</li>
        <li><b>$0 annual fee</b>, so you can reinvest in motivational wall art instead</li>
        <li><b>Welcome bonus:</b> Earn $750 after spending $6,000 in 3 months. You know you’ll find a way (just count those Staples receipts)</li>
        <li><b>0% intro APR for 12 months</b> on purchases—good for launching, ignoring bills, and “temporary” expenses that last forever</li>
        <li>Employee cards at no extra cost, just in case you want to reward your pet intern</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reality Check (Because Every Biz Has One)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No bonus spend categories—so if you travel or advertise nonstop, there are better cards (and you probably don’t care)</li>
        <li>Requires good credit, so don’t apply if your LLC is you with a fake mustache</li>
        <li>No fancy travel perks or premium lounge passes. You’ll have to pay for airport coffee like a normal person</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Who Should Get It?</h2>
    <p>
        If your business life is a mix of Uber receipts, Amazon office supplies, and sporadic “real” bills, this card is tailor-made for you. It’s the card for people who don’t want to optimize, just collect cash back. Finally—less paperwork, more side hustle joy.
    </p>
    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
        The <span class="snark">Ink Business Unlimited®</span> is no-nonsense, no frills, and practically built for the 2025 freelancer economy. Yes, there are fancier cards—but for pure, reliable cash back that doesn’t require a finance degree, this is the business power move.
