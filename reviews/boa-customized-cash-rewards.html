    <h1>Bank of America® Customized Cash Rewards Review: Spin the Wheel, Pick Your Perks</h1>
    <p>
        Not sure if you want cash back on gas, groceries, or online shopping? With the <span class="snark">Bank of America® Customized Cash Rewards Card</span>, you don’t have to decide—just change categories whenever real life changes (which is weekly).
        It’s a rewards card for commitment-phobes.
    </p>
    <h2>The Good Stuff</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>3% cash back</b> on your choice of category (gas, online shopping, dining, travel, drug stores, or home improvement/furnishings)</li>
        <li><b>2% cash back</b> on grocery stores and wholesale clubs</li>
        <li><b>1% back</b> on everything else—yep, even those random last-minute purchases</li>
        <li><b>No annual fee</b> so you can collect rewards without giving it all back</li>
        <li><b>Signup bonus</b>: $200 online cash rewards after $1,000 spent in three months—easy money for shelling out on rent day</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Not-So-Great</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3% category capped at $2,500 quarterly (across choice + groceries/wholesale), so big spenders hit the wall quick</li>
        <li>You must manually pick/change your 3% category, or you’ll get stuck with gas—the default—forever</li>
        <li>Bank of America customer service: sometimes feels like yelling into the void</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Who Is This Card For?</h2>
    <p>
        Anyone who wants flexible rewards for unpredictable spending. Don’t want to play the “rotating category” game? This is the pick-your-reward card for you. Just remember to switch categories before your shopping sprees.
    </p>
    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
        The <span class="snark">Customized Cash Rewards Card</span> is perfect for people whose favorite reward is “whatever saves me money right now.” You get the perks, you skip the annual fee, and you control the earnings. Just don’t forget—you have to actually <b>pick</b> what you want. Bank of America won’t guess for you.
