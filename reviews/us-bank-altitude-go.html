    <h1>U.S. Bank Altitude Go Visa Signature® Card Review: Let the Binge-Watching Begin</h1>
    <p>
        If your idea of a loyalty program means never missing dinner and blowing paychecks on Netflix, the <span class="snark">U.S. Bank Altitude Go</span> is basically a rewards card built for 2025 millennials—and Gen Zs who want 4x points eating out. Don’t expect airport lounges, but you’ll never pay for Spotify again.
    </p>
    <h2>What’s Actually Good?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>4x points on dining</b>—actual restaurants, takeout, delivery, all of it.</li>
        <li><b>2x points on groceries, gas, and streaming</b>—because someone has to keep Hulu in business.</li>
        <li><b>1x on everything else</b>—yes, everything.</li>
        <li><b>$15 annual streaming credit</b>—just remember to claim before you waste it.</li>
        <li><b>No annual fee</b>—finally, a card that won’t charge you for being alive.</li>
        <li>Bonus offer: Earn 20,000 points for spending $1,000 in your first 90 days—that’s free Chipotle for a month (if you pace yourself).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What’s Annoying?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No luxury travel features—this card is for foodies and binge watchers, not jetsetters.</li>
        <li>Requires good credit to qualify. Sorry, not for you TikTok crypto gamblers.</li>
        <li>Some categories like “streaming” require manual activation. If you forget, the $15 credit disappears into the void.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Should You Actually Get This?</h2>
    <p>
        If you dine out more than you meal prep and binge TV faster than you pay bills, this card brings big value. Skip it if you never eat out or want fancy airport perks.
    </p>
    <h2>The Snarky Verdict</h2>
    <p>
        The <span class="snark">U.S. Bank Altitude Go</span> is ideal for everyday people who just want rewards for living their extremely normal lives. It doesn’t pretend to be elite, but your streaming and food habits might finally pay off. It’s the ultimate card for “adulting lite.”
