    <h1>Discover it® Student Cash Back Review: Training Wheels for Your Wallet</h1>
    <p>
        For college students who want to build credit without blowing it all on late-night pizza, the <span class="snark">Discover it® Student Cash Back</span> is basically a starter pack for adulthood. This is one of the few things in college you won’t regret in five years.
    </p>
    <h2>Perks That (Actually) Matter</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>5% cash back on rotating categories</b> (Amazon, gas, restaurants, etc.), so you can pretend you understand “budgeting.”</li>
        <li><b>1% back on everything else</b>—so you always get something, even if you mess up the calendar.</li>
        <li><b>Cashback Match:</b> Discover doubles all your cash back the first year. Yes, really. No math degree required.</li>
        <li><b>No annual fee</b>—you spent it all on tuition anyway.</li>
        <li><b>Good Grade Reward:</b> $20 statement credit for GPAs over 3.0. If only passing stats paid this well.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Some Bummer Trade-Offs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rotating categories—don’t forget to activate or you’ll miss out. (Reminder: adulting includes “chores.”)</li>
        <li>Discover not accepted everywhere—your favorite taco truck might just say “nah.”</li>
        <li>No travel perks, fancy nonsense, or airline lounges. You’re a student, not a CEO.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Who Needs This?</h2>
    <p>
        Students and young adults who want rewards, a credit score that doesn’t make loan officers weep, and simple terms. If “rotating category” sounds like too much effort, look elsewhere.
    </p>
    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
        The <span class="snark">Discover it® Student Cash Back</span> is for people ready to start adulting, one month at a time. Your future self will thank you; your taco truck, maybe not.
    </p>
    <p class="disclaimer">
        *Not funded by Discover—sadly. Read those rotating categories, live your best college life, and maybe stop spending cash back on vending machine burritos.
