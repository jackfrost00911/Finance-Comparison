    <h1>Citi Premier® Card Review: For Jetsetters Who Don’t Want to Sell a Kidney for Points</h1>
    <p>
        The <span class="snark">Citi Premier® Card</span> is for travelers who like rewards but hate complexity. It’s the “I don’t need a $695 fee and a velvet rope lounge, thanks” option. Earn big points, travel with style, and maybe even remember to use those transfer partners.
    </p>
    <h2>What’s Actually Worthwhile?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>3x points on air travel, hotels, restaurants, supermarkets, and gas.</b> If you aren’t earning, you aren’t eating.</li>
        <li><b>1x points on everything else</b>—so you always get something.</li>
        <li><b>80,000 point bonus</b> for spending $4,000 in three months—time to book that “business” trip to Cancun.</li>
        <li><b>$100 annual hotel savings credit</b> for bookings $500+—finally, actual money back.</li>
        <li><b>$95 annual fee</b>—it’s not free, but it’s way less horrifying than most “premium” cards.</li>
        <li>Transfer points to more than a dozen partners—useful if you like spreadsheets or just trust Citi’s travel portal.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Things That Could Be Better</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No luxury lounge access—keep dreaming, travel influencer.</li>
        <li>Complex point transfers, so bring your patience or ignore altogether.</li>
        <li>Annual fee is still $95, but you’ll probably make it back with one decent trip.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Who Is This Card For?</h2>
    <p>
        If you want solid rewards, flexibility for flights and hotels, and hate paying through the nose for “luxury,” this card checks all the boxes. If you need concierge-level pampering, try Amex Platinum instead.
    </p>
    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
        The <span class="snark">Citi Premier® Card</span> lets you travel smart (and kinda fancy) without blowing the budget on annual fees. It’s flexible, rewarding, and maybe… just maybe… the realistic travel card for 2025.
