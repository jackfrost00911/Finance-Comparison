    <h1>Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card Review: The 2% Card for People Who Hate Thinking</h1>
    <p>
        If you want your cash back without categories, headaches, or reading 32 pages of fine print, meet your new best friend: the <span class="snark">Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card</span>.
        This is the “I'm too lazy for spreadsheets but want every last cent” card.
    </p>
    <h2>No-BS Rewards (Finally)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>2% cash back on everything</b>—yes, literally everything, all the time.</li>
        <li><b>$0 annual fee</b>—because you shouldn’t pay money for the privilege of getting your own money back.</li>
        <li><b>$200 welcome bonus</b> for spending just $500 in the first 3 months. That’s like two trips to Costco.</li>
        <li>0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and eligible balance transfers—for when life happens and your budget doesn't.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What’s Actually Annoying?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No fancy travel perks (boo hoo).</li>
        <li>Wells Fargo’s “customer service” can be...let’s just say, a vibe.</li>
        <li>You’ll still need good-to-excellent credit—so maybe don’t torch your score on meme stocks first.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>So, Who Is This Card For?</h2>
    <p>
        You want max rewards with zero extra brain power? No time for bonus categories, rotating whatevers, or remembering if streaming is in your “quarterly 5% bucket”?
        This card was basically built for you.
    </p>
    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>
        The <span class="snark">Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card</span> is the peanut butter and jelly of credit cards: basic, satisfying, and almost impossible to screw up.
        If you want higher rewards, go hustle for it. If you want easy, this
        is <b>the</b> card.
