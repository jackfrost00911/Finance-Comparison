    <h1>CardSnark FAQ: The Snark Stops Here</h1>

    <p>Welcome to CardSnark.cc’s FAQ—where we decode the fine print and roast the banking world until it’s well done. We’re the anti-boring credit card comparison site that helps you find the best plastic for your wallet without putting you to sleep.</p>

    <h2>What the Hell is CardSnark, Anyway?</h2>
    <p>CardSnark is your sarcastic guide to smarter credit card choices. We compare cash-back, travel, and rewards cards, then sprinkle in enough wit to make APRs slightly less painful. Think of us as NerdWallet’s rebellious cousin who actually tells you when a card sucks.</p>

    <h2>How Do You Make Money Without Screwing Me Over?</h2>
    <p>When you click an “Apply Now” button and get approved, we make a tiny commission. But here’s the twist—we don’t recommend cards just because they pay us. We roast the bad ones equally. Transparency is our middle name (okay, not legally, but it should be).</p>

    <h2>Are Your Reviews Actually Unbiased, or Just Snarky Sales Pitches?</h2>
    <p>Our reviews are unbiased… and hilariously honest. We don’t sugarcoat nonsense fees or “exclusive perks” that benefit nobody. If a card’s a winner, we’ll say it. If it’s trash, prepare for a verbal takedown worthy of late-night TV.</p>

    <h2>How Do I Pick the Right Card Without My Head Exploding?</h2>
    <p>Easy: use our filters, sanity, and sarcasm. Spend a lot on gas? We’ll point you to top cash-back cards. Jetsetter? Hit our travel lineup. Debt juggling? Chase those zero APR deals. We make comparing cards idiot-proof—no calculator needed.</p>

    <h2>What If I Apply and Get Denied? Do I Look Like a Financial Loser?</h2>
    <p>Nope. We’ve all been there. Credit scores are picky and border on judgmental. CardSnark links to pre-qualification tools to help you check your odds without tanking your credit. Denied? No shame—come back, rebuild, and we’ll snark you into success.</p>

    <h2>Why the Snarky Tone? Can't You Just Be Normal Like Everyone Else?</h2>
    <p>Normal websites are boring, and the credit card industry is absurd—it deserves mockery. CardSnark turns fine-print dread into actual laughs, keeping you informed without yawning through “APR disclosures.” If we don’t laugh about interest rates, we’ll cry.</p>

    <h2>Is My Info Safe on CardSnark? Or Are You Selling My Soul?</h2>
    <p>Relax. We don’t store, mine, or sell your personal data. You can browse safely and apply directly through bank issuers. No sketchy pop-ups, no shady data deals—just sarcasm and savings, sealed with encryption.</p>

    <h2>How’s CardSnark Different from NerdWallet or Bankrate?</h2>
    <p>They’re corporate suit-and-tie; we’re hoodie-and-coffee. We skip generic fluff, simplify comparisons, and keep it real. No pay-to-play rankings, just sharp advice from real humans who know how credit cards actually work.</p>

    <h2>Still Got Questions (or Rage About Your Card)?</h2>
    <p>Shoot us a message via our <a href="/contact/">contact page</a>. We love your angry rants and awkward finance confessions—they keep our sarcasm sharp and our reviews honest.</p>
