  <h1>How Credit Actually Works</h1>
  <p>If you thought your credit score was a secret society handshake you missed, welcome to the club. Here’s how the system really works, and why (spoiler) it’s not out to get you — but it might enjoy your misery.</p>
  <h2>The Score Haters</h2>
  <p>Your score is a mysterious number between 300 and 850 that somehow controls your financial life, your mortgage rates, and apparently how attractive you are to lenders. It’s made up of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Payment History (35%)</strong> — Pay late once, and it’ll haunt you longer than that one ex.</li>
    <li><strong>Amounts Owed (30%)</strong> — Keep your card balances low or explain yourself to the robot overlords.</li>
    <li><strong>Length of Credit History (15%)</strong> — Older accounts get brownie points. Yes, more than your alma mater.</li>
    <li><strong>Credit Mix (10%)</strong> — Having a mortgage and a car loan makes you look responsible. Or in debt.</li>
    <li><strong>New Credit (10%)</strong> — Too many applications? Calm down, big spender. You’re desperate.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Sure, the formula is a mystery, but the math is simple: pay on time, don’t max out your cards, and keep those old accounts alive.</p>
